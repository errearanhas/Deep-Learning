# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
[Coursera Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) from deeplearning.ai.

 * *Teaching Assistant:* Younes Bensouda Mourri. Mathematical & Computational Sciences, Stanford University;
 
## Intro
In this repository I will keep my Programming Assignments for Deep Learning specialization on Coursera. Currently (Nov '19), I have just started the last course of this 5-course specialization. All the content here available is taken from my assignments in Deep Learning Specialization site on Coursera (unless specified otherwise).

## What is this repository for?
**tl;dr** --> I hope this repo can be useful, as a reference, for someone interested in Deep Learning. :+1:

I recently finished my MSc in Applied Mathematics, and just started a PhD in Artificial Intelligence. I have strong interest in Machine Learning and analytics in general, and although formal learning (classmates, books, whiteboard, etc) is of great relevance to me, I feel very happy in finding so many good free (or almost free) resources available online, helping people all over the world with "on demand learning". So, I hope this humble repo can be useful for someone out there.

Note: I will update the repository as I progress through the specialization.
