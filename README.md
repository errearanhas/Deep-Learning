## Intro
In this repository I will keep my Programming Assignments for Deep Learning specialization on Coursera. Currently (July '19), I have just finished the first of this 5 courses specialization. All the content here available is taken from Deep Learning Specialization site on Coursera (unless specified otherwise).

## What is this repository for?
**tl;dr** --> I hope this repo can be useful for someone. :+1:

I have recently finished my MS in Applied Mathematics, and just started a PhD in Artificial Intelligence. I have strong interest in Machine Learning and analytics in general. Although formal learning (classmates, whiteboard, etc) is of great importance to me, I am very happy for so many free (or almost free) resources made available online, helping self service and on demand learning. So, I hope this humble repo can be useful for someone.

Note: I will update the repository as I progress through the specialization.
