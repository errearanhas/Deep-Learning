## Intro
In this repository I will keep my Programming Assignments for Deep Learning specialization on Coursera. Currently (July '19), I have just finished the first of this 5 courses specialization. All the content here available is taken from Deep Learning Specialization site on Coursera (unless specified otherwise).

## What is this repository for?
**tl;dr** --> I hope this repo can be useful for someone. :+1:

I have recently finished my MS in Applied Mathematics, and just started a PhD in Artificial Intelligence. I have strong interest in Machine Learning and analytics in general, and although formal learning (classmates, books, whiteboard, etc) is of great relevance to me, I am very happy for having so many good free (or almost free) resources available online, helping people all over the world with "on demand learning". So, I hope this humble repo can be useful for someone out there.

Note: I will update the repository as I progress through the specialization.
